# Binary Search Tree

A small, simple Binary Search Tree implementation in Java. Made for educational purposes while reading *Grokking Algorithms and Data Structures*, and for fun.

## Features

- Insert nodes
- In-order traversal
- Search for a value
- Delete a node (re-links subtrees automatically)

```bash
javac src/com/company/*.java
java -cp src com.company.Main
```
